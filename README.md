# Revenue-FCST-Model
Scalable Hotel Revenue Forecasting Using Ensemble Machine Learning

Overview
The Revenue FCST Model is a comprehensive machine learning ensemble system designed to forecast daily hotel revenue with market segment granularity. Built using CRISP-DM methodology, this scalable solution processes individual reservation data to deliver accurate evenue predictions while maintaining complete portability across different hotel properties.

Key Features

Ensemble Architecture: Multiple specialized models combined for superior accuracy
Rate Code Level Granularity: Forecasting at the most granular level for precise insights
Zero Hardcoding: Fully configurable through mapping tables and containers
Cloud-Native: Designed for Azure and Snowflake deployment
Real-Time Processing: Daily automated updates with live data integration
Scalable Design: Universal hotel mathematics - deploy to any property by updating data containers

Architecture
Container Structure
Core Data Containers

Historical Reservations: Date-partitioned completed stays with realized revenue
On-the-Books (OTB): Active reservations for future arrivals
Cancellation Data: Separate tracking of cancelled reservations with reason codes

Dimension Tables

Room Type Mapping: Room codes, categories, revenue weights
Market Segment Mapping: Segment codes, behavior patterns, seasonality factors
Rate Code Mapping: Rate categories, pricing rules, channel information
Property Configuration: Hotel-specific constants (room count, competitor sets, market positioning)

Model Components
1. Revenue FCST Model (Primary)
The main ensemble model combining multiple forecasting approaches:

Time series analysis for seasonal patterns
Gradient boosting for complex feature interactions
